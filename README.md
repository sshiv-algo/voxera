#ABSTRACT
Voxera is a secure and user-friendly web-based application designed to empower students to raise concerns related to college infrastructure issues and personal grievances in a safe and structured manner. The platform acts as a digital bridge between students and the college administration, ensuring that issues are reported and addressed efficiently.

Voxera allows students to submit complaints anonymously or with their identity, covering a wide range of topics including infrastructure (e.g., broken desks, damaged washrooms, electrical faults) and sensitive concerns (e.g., harassment, abuse, or misconduct). To maintain safety and confidentiality, sensitive complaints are routed privately to authorized faculty or admin and are excluded from the public feed.

The application features a modern complaint feed where students can view non-sensitive complaints, interact using likes/dislikes, and monitor the status of their submissions (Pending, In Progress, Resolved). Each complaint can include descriptions, categories, and optional photo evidence.

Admins and authorized faculty members have access to dedicated dashboards to review, manage, assign, and update complaints. Faculty members can only access complaints assigned to them. The system enforces accountability while improving complaint resolution turnaround time and ensuring clear communication between the student body and college authorities.

Voxera is committed to creating a safe, transparent, and responsive environment for students by blending modern UI, anonymity support, and structured workflows.
